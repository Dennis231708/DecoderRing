This is a thinkful project where I was able to work on complex algorithms as well as unit testing with mocha and chai. The purpose of the program is to allow users to encode or decode messages in any of three ways. Caesar’s shift, The polybius square, or the substitution cipher. Caesar’s shift works by shifting the letters down the alphabet with the given shift amount to encode a message, and shifting the letters the opposite direction to decode the messages. The polybius square method translates letters into numbers or vice versa based on the position of the character on a two dimensional chart. Finally, the substitution cipher works by taking in an alphabet from the user and exchanging letters from the English alphabet with the given one to create an encoded or decoded message.
